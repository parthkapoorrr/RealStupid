## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Use Deep Void (#121218) for the entire page background.
- Content Cards: Make the cards for each post a slightly lighter shade of the background, like #1A1A20, to create subtle separation.
- Text: All main text should be Paper White (#F5F5F7).
- Upvote Button: When clicked, it should blaze with Electric Cyan / Pure Aqua (#00FFFF). Unclicked, it can be a simple Paper White outline.
- Links: All hyperlinks should be Electric Cyan / Pure Aqua (#00FFFF).
- "Post" or "Comment" Buttons: Solid Electric Cyan / Pure Aqua (#00FFFF) with Deep Void text for maximum impact.
- Notifications: A Electric Cyan / Pure Aqua (#00FFFF) dot on the bell icon.
- Downvote/Error Color: A muted, desaturated magenta like #D946EF (Vibrant Fuchsia) would work perfectly, maintaining the rebellious, digital vibe without clashing with the cyan.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for a modern, slightly techy look.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for clear and readable text.
- Use simple, outline-style icons to represent different communities and actions.
- Subtle animations on voting and comment interactions.
